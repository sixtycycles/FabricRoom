## Fabric Room ###
### This is the django code to render [60hz.dev](https://60hz.dev) ###

This project is a personal website for myself. I am building tools as i need them and adding on to this app. I run it in a digital ocean droplet, but it should run on any typical django deployment. I will try to keep the requirements.txt file up to date.
